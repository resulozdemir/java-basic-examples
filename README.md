## Repository Layout

| Folder | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| `Java101/` | Core syntax, operators, loops, methods, simple algorithms |
| `Java102/` | Object-oriented programming, inheritance, interfaces, small OOP games |
| `hazirlik/` | Misc preparation files & algorithm notes |

Inside each folder every `.java` file has its own `public static void main` so it can be compiled and run independently. 📄
